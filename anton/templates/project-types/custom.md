# Custom Project

## Stack
To be determined during the interactive requirements phase.

## Constraints
The PM and Architect agents will define the stack and constraints based on user requirements.

## Notes
Use this project type when none of the predefined types fit. The interactive session should establish:
- Build tool and framework
- Deployment target and method
- Any platform-specific constraints
- Required dependencies

Document all decisions in `./docs/architecture.md`.
